# mazeGenerator
A maze generator using stacks and depth first search, written in JavaScript

Unvisited tiles are grey, tiles that are visited and on the stack are blue, 
while tiles that are visited but no longer on the stack are purple.

After the algorithm is finished you simply remove two "walls" - one for the entry of the maze and one for the exist.
